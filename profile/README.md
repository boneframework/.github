# Welcome üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
Bone Framework is the quickest and easiest way to start making both websites and native apps. 

Almost every app needs secure user login functionaslity. With Bone Native, you can have a ready-to-rock smartphone app with user registration taken care of. The Backend API
is secured via OAuth2, the same secure login system used by Facebook, X, Google, and others.
